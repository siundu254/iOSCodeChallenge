# NASA API

## Overview

The project demonstrates Fetching data, parsing model entities from JSON, Use of MVVM-C to build UI and Navigation. The App is purely built on AutoLayout and UIKit. The primary language used is swift.

### Features

- [x] Home View
      * Display Loading View on Initial Loading
      * Fetch nasa data asynchronously
      * Update UI accordingly
      * Handle Error States
      * Test View Model to assert data is not nil
- [x] Detail View
      * Display a detail view of the nasa images info
      * Handle smoooth back navigation

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 13.0+

### Built With

Language used when building this project :

* [Swift 5](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-released/)

### Dependency Management

#### CocoaPods
You have to install Cocoa pods in your machine like so:
```sh
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To get started, move inside your WeatherApp folder and run
```sh
pod init
```

This creates a Podfile, which will hold all your dependencies in one place. Currently all dependencies are already added to podfile so you can run

```sh
pod install
```

### Project Structure

To keep all those hundreds of source files from ending up in the same directory, we used a folder structure in relation to the architecture used:

    ├─ Coordinator
    ├─ ViewModels
    ├─ Views
    ├─ Controllers
    ├─ Networking Layer
    ├─ Supporting Files
    ├─ Common Files
    
## Architecture
 * [Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator](MVVM-C)
 * Motivated by "massive view controllers": MVVM considers `UIViewController` subclasses part of the View and keeps them slim by maintaining all state in the ViewModel.
 * To learn more about it, check out Bob Spryn's [fantastic introduction][sprynthesis-mvvm].
 * Coordinators are used to help in easy navigation between view controllers
